# Scala Game of Life

## Overview

This project is an implementation of the famous "Game of Life," a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway. This version is written in Scala and was collaboratively developed by two developers. Our Game of Life simulation demonstrates the power of Scala in creating complex, rule-based simulations with simple, elegant code.

## Features

- Simulation of Conway's Game of Life.
- Scalable grid to observe the evolution of cells over time.
- Configurable rules and initial states for diverse simulation experiences.
- User-friendly interface to interact with the simulation.

## Technologies Used

- **Language:** Scala

## Installation and Usage

To run the Game of Life simulation, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Alexis-Marcel/GameOfLife.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the repository directory:
   ```
   cd GameOfLife
   ```
3. Compile the project:
   ```
   scalac JeuDeLaVie.scala
   ```
4. Run the simulation:
   ```
   scala JeuDeLaVie
   ```
## Contributing

Contributions to enhance the simulation and add new features are welcome. Please feel free to fork the repository and submit pull requests.
